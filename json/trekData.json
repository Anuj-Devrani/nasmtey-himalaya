        "question": "Is there any ATM close to the Kedarkantha trek and Do I get a network on the Kedarkantha trek?",
        "answer": "The last ATM en route to the base camp is in Mori. Mori has an SBI bank with an ATM attached to it. However, the ATM is empty of cash many times. In such a case, you may head out to an SBI authorized cash withdrawal centre. You can swipe your card and get cash from the person servicing the desk. This centre is located on the first floor, two buildings to the right of SBI. Although Mori has this possibility, we strongly encourage trekkers to bring cash or to withdraw cash from the 3 ATMs available in Purola (SBI, ICICI and Axis Bank ATMs). Kedarkantha is a secluded place so most of the mobile networks do not work here but you can carry a sim of BSNL because in base camp and near by places it works good."

    "overview": "Located in the heart of Garhwal Himalayas, Kuari Pass is one of the most magnificent treks in Uttarakhand to explore. Being an easy trek, it is an absolute blessing for anyone who is not prepared for a rigorous one and yet wants to experience the marvelous feeling of wandering along the trails of relatively unspoiled wilderness. The maximum altitude of the trek is 12,763 ft. The trek is also known as Lord Curzon’s Trails because it was Lord Curzon who happened to make the discovery of this trek-route. Several regions of the trek allow you to have a 360-degree view of the Himalayan peaks which undoubtedly form the heart of the trek. It offers the view of peaks from 7000 meters club including Trishul (7120m), Kamet (7756m), Nanda Devi (7817m), Chaukhamba (7128m), and the majestic twin peaks of Nanda Devi East (7434m). Other prominent peaks that make their appearance include Mukut Parbat, Mana, Rishi Pahad, and Changbang, Nanda Ghunti, Hathi Ghoda Parbat, Neelkanth, Dronagiri, and many such mountains tops. The trek commences at Joshimath, which lies in the Chamoli district of Himalayas. Gradually, Joshimath has come to be popular as a hub for trekkers and pilgrims in the Gharwal region of the Himalayas. Apart from mighty mountain ranges, the region is also the home of several perennial rivers which most importantly includes the Pancha-Prayag – namely, Devprayag, Karnaprayag, and Rudraprayag. Other rivers include Pinder, Kaliganga, Nandakini, Buriganga & Dhauli Ganga. Another treasure that this trail beholds is the cultural treasure, the small remote hamlets that you will cross through on your way uphill. It will enrich your knowledge about the culture and life of mountain folks. Flora and fauna found in the place make it even more captivating and enticing. Himalayan black bears and the paw prints of leopards are also sometimes sighted on the track uphill. The trail is almost throughout accompanied by thick forest covers with mixed vegetation of Oak, rhododendrons, and other coniferous trees. In the month of March, the glimpses of white and pink cherry blossoms are seen. The trail with a combination of smooth and rugged terrain, mostly covered with snow is no less than a paradise for trek enthusiasts.",
    "trekHighlights": [
      "One of the major attractions of the trek is the expanse of dense forest consisting of oak and rhododendrons. The forests are of ancient origin which makes them even more spectacular. The trails make its way through patches of thick forests followed by open grounds and lush green meadows further followed by forests. This interplay of landscapes makes the trek much more interesting and intriguing.",
      "A gorgeous feature that attracts swarms of people from across the globe to this place is the army of mountains that it unravels to you- starting from Nandadevi and Dronagiri and further ascending to the sight of Neelkanth, Mukut Parbat, Rishi Pahad, Changbang, and the like. The view of the horizon adorned with these jewels is beautiful enough to restore the dead to life. Kuari Pass trek with the view of such a skyline introduces you to the eternal beauty of Earth.",
      "Another major highlight which makes Kuari Pass Trek a wonder that it is, is the ethereal setting of the campsites. Contrary to the popular belief that trekking is all about ascending and descending rush, Kuari Pass trek compels you to pause. It offers you the campsite that makes you want to stay and adore the blessings of nature. Whether it be the Khulla campsite with Mt. Dronagiri forming the backdrop or the campsite at Chitrakantha amidst the mighty forests, everything about the campsites at Kuari Pass Trek is awe-inspiring."

        "question": "What is Kuari pass trek difficulty?",
        "answer": "Kuari Pass is classified under the category of the easy-moderate trek. Therefore this is considered as the most ideal trek for a beginner. Yet being a trek it offers its own sets of challenges, which include the high altitude, rocky terrains, and trail that involves a steep climb. One should, hence, be both physically fit and ideally equipped before undertaking the trek. The trek starts at an altitude of 6,900 feet from Dhak which further reaches up to a maximum altitude of 12,763 feet above sea Level which is encountered at the pass. The temperature variations and the weather conditions are also fierce which demands before-hand preparations. The average trek duration experienced everyday forms an average of 4-5 hours except on the day involving the crossing of the pass when it takes an average of 8 hours. This short span of the trek is another factor which makes it favourable for beginners."

        "question": "What is the distance of the Kuari pass trek?",

Kuari Pass Trek is extremely flexible in the context of its itinerary and trail because it can be approached from many different tracks. If approached with Dhak as the starting point, further two trails options are available up to Khullara campsite- one through Guling and another through Akhrotghetta. On the way down from Auli, there are again two options for camping which include the beautiful site of Chitrakantha and Tali."
